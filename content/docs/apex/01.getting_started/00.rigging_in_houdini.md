Rigging in Houdini consists of two overlapping systems:

- **KineFX**: KineFX uses geometry to define a skeleton and is used as the basis for the SOP based rigging tools, motion retargeting and crowd agent setup.
- **APEX**: APEX runs on its own execution engine, and is focuses on providing a procedural system for building rigs, tied to an animator friendly viewport state that efficient evaluates the rig. 

SideFX often use the two terms interchangeably and while there are some distinctions between the two, it makes sense. KineFX and SOPs prepare the skeleton and geometry, with APEX building the rig logic and animation controls.  

## KineFX Rigs

KineFX rigs consist of points and polygon lines. The point contain the joint transform matrices and attributes (transform, local transform, scale, joint name), while the line defines the hierarchy of the skeleton. 

One of the advantages of skeletons simply being points with a transform matrix is that Houdini’s usual geometry tools can be use to manipulate them, for example creating a skeleton based off a curve, or procedurally adding joints using a resample, or constraining joints to a surface using a `primuv` lookup.

KineFX can be used for a wide range of tasks (and people are always using it in new and interesting ways!). It’s core uses would be for:

- **Motion Editing**: KineFX allows easy retargeting of motion from one rig onto another, cleaning up motion capture data and editing and manipulating motion.
- **Simulation and Dynamics**: Similarly to secondary motion, KineFX can be easily passed to solver, for example creating a skeleton for a tree, simulating it in vellum, and using that to deform the tree mesh.  
- **Rigs**: KineFX fits within the Houdini toolset that most artist are familiar with. It can be used for rigging plants, generating muscle, building procedural rigs editing motion.
- **Secondary Motion**: Adding secondary motion on top of existing animation, for example lag, overshoot or jiggle.

Given how flexible KineFX is, why would you use APEX? The main reasons that spring to mind are *speed* and *interactivity*.

## APEX Rigs

While APEX is most often associated with rigging, it stands for *All Purpose EXecution* framework, and is also used for Houdini's texturing and compositing framework Copernicus etc. It is an execution framework that runs outside of Houdini, with the emphasis on speed. 

For rigging purposes, it provides a fast environment for executing the rig and deforming geometry, tied closely to the animation state.  The main advantages of APEX are that it offers:

- **Viewport Oriented**: Focusing on providing a fast, interactive viewport, with a range of useful tools for the animator.
- **Flexible**:Designed with traditional and ephemeral rigging in mind.
- **Fast Evaluation**: APEX graphs are both deferred and offer partial evaluation, using the GPU for geometry deformation. 
- **Procedural Graphs**: APEX graphs can generate other APEX graph. This allows for procedural rig setup and also ephemeral rigging through procedurally attaching rigs during animation.
- **Geometry**: Apex graphs are represented as geometry with attributes. 

To a certain extent, this probably feels a slightly abstract, other than the UX and speed benefits, however they will hopefully become clearer as we step through the basics of creating a rig in APEX.
