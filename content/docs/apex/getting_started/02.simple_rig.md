# 02 Example: Basic APEX Rig
The easiest way  to see how this works is with a quick example. Rather than building everything from scratch, this will walk through this hip file:
 [getting_startes.simple_rig.hiplc](/apex/img/getting_startes.simple_rig.hiplc){{< icon "document-download" >}}

### Setting Up Geometry For APEX
The first step it to prepare the geometry for using it in APEX. This consists of three main steps:

1. Building the Skeleton (optionally defining a guide skeleton)
2. Capturing the skin
3. Pack geometry into folders for apex.

- **Skin:** For this example we are going to be skinning the arm of the capybara. The first thing we want to do is delete everything apart from the arm. 
- **Skeleton**: For the base skel, we use the skeleton node to create the  skeleton. We can use the rig pane to quickly rename the joints as we create them. The *Orient Joint* node is used to orient the joints down the z axis. 
- **Guides**: For the guides we are simply adding a tag to specify the arm segment. Tags are just a string array that exists on the Guides skeleton. Here we are just tagging the arm joints, which we are going to use later to apply a basic IK component procedurally. 

> [!Tip]
The **pack folder** SOP automatically names the folders it creates from the input node, and will automatically separate the name and extension for you.

## APEX Nodes

Next up we have the APEX nodes. In this part of the network we are going to use the *APEX Autorig Component* node to build the rig from out skeleton. In our initial setup we are going to create use two autorig components:

- **FK Transform:** Adds controls for all the joints on the skeleton.
- **Bone Deform**: Deforms the skeleton using the joints.

> [!Tip]
Each autorig component has its own animate state so you can test the rig interactively as you build it. 

### Create Rig Joints
If you display the *Create Joint Rig* node and press enter in the viewport, you will see a control for each of the joints.

And if you open an APEX Network View pane, it should look like this:

The Autorig Component  displays the nodes created by the current autorig component in green. 
- The *FK Transform* component is creating a *Transform Object* for each of the joints in the skeleton. These are the controllers that the animator interacts with. 
- On the far right is the *Input*  node; any Chanels plugged in here are promoted. For the joints we've promoted the rotation channel.
- The *Point Transform* takes the transform matrices from the *Transform Objects* and transforms the skeleton geometry by them. 

### Deform Geometry
The second *Autorig Component* add the nodes necessary to deform the skin geometry.

This is the same at the SOP *Joint Deform* node. It takes the rest skeleton, the animated skeleton and uses the transforms to deform the skin geometry. 

## APEX Scene Animate
The final node in our SOP chain is the APEX animate state. This is the node that the animator will use, and is focused on providing a fast interactive environment for animation alongside a suite of useful animation tools (from transient constraints to FBIK and physics). 

Our Capybaras arm already had a bit of animation on it; if you scrub the timeline the arm and fingers should bend. Not the greatest animation perhaps, but there to prove a point; if you go back to the geometry network and switch the *switch_delete_fingers* to 1, you should see the fingers disappear, however the animation remains unchanged, similarly, setting it back to zero and the fingers should reappear with their animation.

This simple setup is fully procedural; as long as the controller names don't change you can add additional features to the rig, but preserve the animation without having to throw away keyframes. Additionally you can swap in different packed folders, for example adding a different character, and still preserve the existing animation.
